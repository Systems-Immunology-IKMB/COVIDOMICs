COVIDomics paper: Transcription factor activity network

Directory data contains normalized sequencing counts and covariates. Additionally, we added RDS files created by the preprocessing step.

Directory code contains all scripts that are necessary to perform the transcription factor activity analysis. To be able to run CARNIVAL, a ILP solver has to be installed. We used CPLEX provided by IBM as solver. Scripts have to be run in numerical order.
