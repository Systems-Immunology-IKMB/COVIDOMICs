__COVIDomics paper: Transcription factor activity network__

Directory _data_ contains normalized sequencing counts and covariates. Additionally, we added RDS files created by the preprocessing step.

Directory _code_ contains all scripts that are necessary to perform the transcription factor activity analysis. To be able to run CARNIVAL, a ILP solver has to be installed. We used CPLEX provided by IBM as solver. Scripts have to be run in numerical order.
